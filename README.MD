# Multi-layer Perceptron

Multi-layer perceptron implementation from scratch developed in the Intelligent Systems course during the Master's Degree in Computer Science

## Proposed Activity

In the main notebook, we implement the logic of a multi-layer perceptron and evaluate its performance using a toy Breast cancer dataset avaible on [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html#sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer)
