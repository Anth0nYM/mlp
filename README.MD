# Multi-layer Perceptron

Multi-layer perceptron implementation from scratch developed in the Intelligent Systems course during the Master's Degree in Computer Science

## Proposed Activity

In the main notebook, we implement the logic of a multi-layer perceptron and evaluate its performance using a public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielfernandon/web-page-phishing-dataset).
